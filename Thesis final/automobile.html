<h1>Vehicle Types</h1>
<p>There are Four main categories of electric drive vehicles:</p>
<p><strong>1. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV)</strong> are powered by an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source that runs on conventional or alternative fuel, as well as an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery. The battery is charged through regenerative braking and by the internal combustion engine, and is not plugged in to charge. Regenerative breaking is a technology by which energy normally lost during braking is captured by the electric motor and stored in the battery for extra power during acceleration. There are two different types of HEVs:</p>
<li><em>Mild hybrid:</em> This type of HEV uses a battery and electric motor to help power the vehicle and can allow the engine to shut off when the vehicle stops (such as at traffic lights or in stop-and-go traffic). Mild hybrid systems cannot power the vehicle using electricity alone. Example: Chevrolet Malibu Eco</li>
<li><em>Full hybrid:</em> This type of HEV generally has more powerful electric motors and larger batteries, which can drive the vehicle on just electric power for short distances and at low speeds.</li>
<p> <strong> Example:</strong> Ford Fusion and Toyota Prius</p>

<p><strong>2.Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV):</strong> Plug-in vehicles refer to any on-road vehicle that can be charged through an external source of electricity. Like HEVs, these vehicles are powered by an internal combustion engine that can run on conventional or alternative fuel, as well as an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery. The difference is that these vehicles can be plugged into an electric power source to charge the battery. PHEVs can have a parallel or series design as well. Example: Chevy Volt</li>

<p><strong>3.Battery electric vehicle (EV):</strong> These vehicles use a battery to store the electric energy that powers the motor. EV batteries are charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source. EVs are sometimes referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs).To more quickly recharge these larger batteries at night when power demand is low, most homes and businesses will require special outlets to be installed that provide 240 volts or higher.
<p>Nissan began U.S. sales of its 100 percent battery electric vehicle , the LEAF, in late 2010. TVA and the state of Tennessee helped develop a launch market for these vehicles.</p> 
<strong>Example:</strong> Nissan Leaf</p>
<p><strong>4.Extended-Range Electric Vehicle:</strong>These vehicles uses a Internal Combustion Engine to power Electric generator.that charges the battery system in a linear process â€” the engine powers a generator, which in turn charges the battery.
<p>The General Motors Chevrolet Volt, which went on sale in the U.S. in late 2010, is an extended-range electric vehicle with an electric-only range of about 40 miles. The Volt extends its range with a small internal combustion engine that charges the batteries. The Volt also can be recharged by plugging into the grid during periods of low power use.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> General Motors Chevrolet Volt </p>
<p><strong>5.Other Personal Electric Vehicles:</strong>   <p>Other electric vehicles &mdash; smaller vehicles with maximum speeds of 25 mph or less &mdash; are classified as neighborhood electric vehicles. Golf carts dominate this vehicle category, but other options are increasingly available, such as electric bicycles.</p>
          <p>Various manufacturers offer three- and four-wheel electric vehicles that can be used in private and  commercial applications, such as airport shuttles. </p>
          <p>Global Electric Motorcars, a Chrysler subsidiary, is the U.S. sales leader in this category. Some cities use these small vehicles for parking meter enforcement.  Some power companies use them to move people and resources at their generating plants.</p>
