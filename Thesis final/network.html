					<h3>CHARGEPOINT</h3>
<div class="fullWidthFigure">
<img src="images/coulomb-charger-card.jpg" alt="Chargepoint Charger" title="Chargepoint Charger" />
</div>
<p><strong>Background:</strong>  Chargepoint, previously Coulomb Technologies, describes itself as the largest online network of independently owned EV charging stations operating in 14 countries.  The company provides a turnkey EV charging solutions for property owners—who can determine the terms for offering charging to EV drivers. <br /><br />
<strong>Approximate Number of Sites:</strong> 3,084<br /><br />
<strong>Coverage:</strong> While one-quarter of ChargePoint stations are in California, the network is the most widely distributed with at least one station in approximately 43 U.S. states.<br /><br />
<strong>Access:</strong> There is no cost to sign up and receive a ChargePoint card.  After submitting your credit card information as part of the sign-up, you will be charged an initial deposit of $25 only when you first visit a charging station that requires a fee. (Many stations on the network are free.) Your account provides access to all public stations on ChargePoint.  Charging stations are activated with the ChargePoint card, or a contactless credit card. The stations can also be activated by calling a toll-free customer service number on the ChargePoint station, or by using the associated mobile app.  Account balances automatically replenish when the balance gets low. <br /><br />
<strong>Cost Per Charge:</strong>  Prices are determined by the property owner.  Many ChargePoint stations are currently free.<br /><br />
<strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://www.chargepoint.com" target="blank">http://www.chargepoint.com</a><br /><br />
<strong>Technical Support:</strong> 24/7 customer support at 888-758-4389, with more robust technical support available 8 am to 5 pm eastern.</p>

            <br/>
 <h3>BLINK NETWORK (Operated by CarCharging Group)</h3>
<div class="fullWidthFigure">
<img src="images\blink-charger.jpg" alt="Blink Charger" title="Blink Charger" />
</div>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The assets of Blink Network were purchased by CarCharging Group in October 2013.  Ecotality had received a $114.8 million federal stimulus grant to oversee The EV Project.  The goal of The EV Project is to deploy 8,300 private and public chargers. There have been several reported problems associated with Blink chargers, and the Blink Network, such as insufficient customer support, and incompatibility of the equipment with certain vehicles.<br /><br />
<strong>Approximate Number of Sites:</strong> 1,680<br /><br />
<strong>Coverage:</strong> Blink Network chargers are located in approximately 25 states, with the largest concentration in California, Arizona, Oregon, Texas, Tennessee and Washington.<br /><br />
<strong>Access:</strong>  Start by registering a credit card with a Blink account.  There are no required annual or monthly membership fees, or minimum credit card balance.  Members who register will receive an “InCard” and can initiate a charge using the card.  Guests can initiate a charge with Blink’s mobile application.<br /><br />
<strong>Cost Per Charge:</strong> In the states that permit kilowatt-hour pricing, fees for Level 2 EV charging stations owned by Blink and operated on the Blink Network range from $0.39 to $0.79 per kWh, depending on the state and individual’s membership status. Blink is a proponent of kWh pricing because it is usage-based and EV drivers pay fees based on the actual amount of power consumed during the charging session rather than the amount of time that the car is plugged into the station.Fees for DCFC chargers owned by Blink and operated on the Blink Network in kWh eligible state range from $0.49 to $0.69 per kWh, depending on the state and individual’s membership status.</p>
<p>These states currently permit fees by the kilowatt-hour: California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>In states where pricing by kWh is not permitted, time-based charging fees for Level 2 charging stations owned by Blink and operated on the Blink Network range from $0.04 to $0.06 per minute, depending on membership status. Time-based charging fees are rounded up to the nearest 30-second interval. Fees for DCFC chargers owned by Blink and operated on the Blink Network in non-kWh eligible states will range from $6.99 - $9.99 per session, depending on membership status.</p>

<h3>SemaConnect</h3>
<div class="list-entry">
<p><a href="http://www.semaconnect.com/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14137" src="http://cdn.ecomento.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Logo_Large.jpg" alt="Logo_Large" width="817" height="323" /></a><a href="https://www.blinknetwork.com/" target="_blank"><br />
</a>SemaConnect operates roughly 2,000 electric car charging stations across North America, spanning from British Columbia to Florida. Like ChargePoint, SemaConnect&#8217;s ChargePro stations are privately owned, and offer AC Level 2 charging for all electric vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>How much?</strong></p>
<p>The cost of charging is at the discretion of the owner of the station, which includes restaurants and departments stores. Many are free, although a charge of around $0.49 per kilowatt-hour is common. That means a Nissan LEAF would cost roughly $12 to charge to maximum capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Access?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">SemaConnect offers the most options for starting a charging session after feedback from EV drivers that they disliked carrying around an RFID card.  You can sign-up for a SemaCharge pass which works like an EZ pass, use their iPhone/Android app, Pay with PlugShare app, simply use your smartphone web browser, use our Google Glass app or charge by scanning a QR code.</p>
<p><strong>Smartphone app?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Yes, SemaConnect&#8217;s app can be found in the Google Play or Apple App store, and can be used to start a charging session, find stations and manage your driver account.</p>
<p class="p1">SemaConnect is also the first charging station company to partner with PlugShare, the most widely used EV app for drivers.  Through a partnership with PlugShare, EV drivers can have the convenience of starting a charging session at a SemaConnect location straight from the PlugShare app!</p>

<h3>EVGO</h3>
<div class="fullWidthFigure">
<img src="images/evgo-charger.jpg" alt="eVgo Charger" title="eVgo Charger" />
</div>
</p><p><strong>Background:</strong>  eVgo is subsidiary of NRG, a Fortune 300 and S&amp;P 500 company. It’s one of the country’s largest power generation and retail electricity businesses, with power plants producing about 47,000 megawatts of generation capacity. eVgo is part of NRG’s clean energy portfolio, which includes solar, thermal, and carbon capture technology.<br /><br />
<strong>Approximate Number of Stations:</strong> Approximately 150, each with Level 2 and DC quick charging options.<br /><br />
<strong>Coverage:</strong> Currently, eVgo operates stations in Texas, in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth markets, as well as Tennessee, California and the greater Washington, DC area.<br /><br />
<strong>Access:</strong>  NRG’s network is only available to its monthly subscribers using an eVgo card, but as its website states, the company “will always take care of an EV driver in need of a charge.”<br /><br />
<strong>Cost Per Charge:</strong>  eVgo offers various plans based on the needs of an EV driver and the electric vehicle they have chosen. This is an overview of their three most popular all-you-can-charge plans. Starting at $30 a month, with a one-year service agreement, EV drivers have access to unlimited charging at the company’s so-called Freedom Station sites, which includes Level 2 and DC fast charging.  The $40 a month Home plan, with a three-year service agreement, adds installation of your own home charging equipment—but not the cost of electricity that is separately metered.  The Workplace plan is $30 a month. See the <a href="http://www.nrgevgo.com/charging-plans-by-market/" target="blank">pricing structure</a>, which is unique to each region.<br /><br />

					<p>The PlugShare Quarterly graph for “DCFC YoY Installations by Standard, 2015-Q1” is even more revealing. DCFC stands for DC fast charging, the means by which EV drivers can use 500-volt stations to replenish 50 to 100 miles of driving range in about 30 minutes. It turns out that Tesla, a private company with a closed proprietary network of chargers, is growing faster than all other DC fast charging protocols combined. Tesla’s Supercharger network, standing now at about 1,135 stations compared to only about 500 a year ago, has surpassed CHAdeMo, which grew from almost 730 stations to about 1,100 in the past year. Meanwhile, the controversial SAE Combo Cord, which was trumpeted as a major innovation, is moving at the slowest pace. The number of compatible fast chargers using that protocol, primarily for German and American electric cars, is below 200. </P>
