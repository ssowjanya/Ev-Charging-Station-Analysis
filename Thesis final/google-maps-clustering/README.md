google-maps-clustering
======================

This is the skeleton application of google maps api v3 that contains clustering , location finder , custom markers , customized info box, etc..

Intially the map loaded based on user location , for all specified fuctionalities just zoom out the map.

Note : This map getting data from json file. Here you can use remote json feed also.
I tested this app with api v3 , for api v2 you need to change some code.
