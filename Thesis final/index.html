								<strong>Electric vehicle charging station</strong> also called <strong>EV charging station, electric recharging point, charging point, charge point and EVSE</strong>(Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment), is an element in an infrastructure that supplies electric energy for the recharging of electric vehicles, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle>electric Vehicles</a>
								 such as plug-in electric vehicles, including electric cars, neighborhood electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

As plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicle ownership is expanding, there is a growing need for widely distributed publicly accessible charging stations, some of which support faster charging at higher voltages and currents than are available from residential EVSEs. Many charging stations are on-street facilities provided by electric utility companies or located at retail shopping centers and operated by many private companies. These charging stations provide one or a range of heavy duty or special connectors that conform to the variety of electric charging connector standards. Electric car stations are of public and private stations.

								Charging stations fall into four basic contexts:

Residential charging stations: An EV owner plugs in when they return home, and their car recharges overnight. A home charging station usually has no user authentication, no metering, and may require wiring a dedicated circuit. Some portable chargers can be wall mounted as a charging station.
Charging while parked (including public charging stations) – a commercial venture charged or free, offered in partnership with the owners of the parking lot. This charging may be slow or higher speed, and encourages EV owners to recharge their car while they take advantage of nearby facilities. It can include parking stations, parking at malls, small centres and train stations (and for a businesses own employees).
Fast charging at public charging stations >40 kW, delivering over 60 miles (100 km) of range in 10–30 minutes. These chargers may be at rest stops to allow for longer distance trips. They may also be used regularly by commuters in metropolitan areas, and for charging while parked for short or longer periods. Common examples are CHAdeMO and SAE CCS chargers, and Tesla Superchargers.
Battery swaps or charges in under 15 minutes. A specified target for CARB credits for a zero-emission vehicle is adding 200 miles to its range in under 15 minutes. In 2014, this was not possible for charging electric vehicles, but it is achievable with EV battery swaps and Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicles. It intends to match the refueling expectations of regular drivers.

		There are three levels commonly used to describe the charging power of EVSE: Level 1, Level 2 and DC
Fast Charging. The amount of range provided for each of these is shown in Figure 1.3 below with
additional details in the following sections with miles per hour.</p>
